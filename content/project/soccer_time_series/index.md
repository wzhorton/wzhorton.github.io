Time-series was one of the last classes I took in my PhD. I'm not going to say it was like therapy, but it sure felt nice to end on a high note. This project served as a two-day tame-home final exam where the focus was to model both the trend and seasonal behavior of the "soccer" search index. If you aren't familiar with DLMs, the technical details might be a little overwhelming, but the results highlight the power of this criminally underused tool. It is admittedly hard to get started with DLMs, but hey, so is therapy.
