Recurrent event modeling is like the estranged point-process cousin who lives on the outskirts of survival analysis. Maybe that's an odd analogy, but it rings true in my experience. This poster was presented at the 2022 ARCS Symposium meeting, an event that honors ARCS Foundation donors and highlights the work of ARCS scholars. It showcases a Bayesian nonparametric earthquake recurrence model that was foundational to my PhD projects. The poster is intended for a non-technical audience, so it leaves out a lot of fun nerdy details. But the graphs tell a nice visual story and, if nothing else, the color scheme is lovely.
