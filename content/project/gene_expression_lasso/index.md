I've been studying statistics for the better part of 10 years now and I still can't tell you what LASSO stands for. *Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator*? Seems like a stretch. Wikipedia doesn't even capitalize every letter so, like, what's the point? But I digress. This project was a short group exercise for an applied modeling course during my master's. Gene expression is textbook example of how using LASSO regression can help overcome issues with high-dimensional data and multicollinearity. Our group actually won donuts for the clearest presentation, so it holds a special place in my memory despite the simplicity. I'm never going to remember what LASSO stands for though.
