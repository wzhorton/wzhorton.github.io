## Delivering Impactful Insights Through Thoughtful, Data-Driven Analysis

Yeah, the tagline is a little dorky, but it comes with the territory. Thanks for visiting my site! I'm a soon-to-graduate PhD candidate studying statistics and a part-time quant researcher. My academic research focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics and renewal processes, but I'm also interested in risk modeling, quantitative finance, and data science more broadly. So, if you need someone capable of delivering impactful insights through thoughtful, data-driven analysis *- corny shudders -* let's chat!
